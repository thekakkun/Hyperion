# Hyperion
Hyperion is a desk clock that uses Soviet-era IN-12 nixie tubes as digit displays.

## Features:
- Created based on the [NCV2.1-NN kit by TubeHobby](https://tubehobby.com/show_det.php?det=43). The kit was modified in order to accomodate the IN-12 nixie tubes I used.
- Automatic time synchronization. Instead of using a GPS module, a [Particle WiFi Development Board](https://store.particle.io/products/photon) was used to get the current time via WiFi and generate a GPS signal to be sent to the electronics.
