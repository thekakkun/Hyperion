# Hyperion
Hyperion is a desk clock that uses Soviet-era IN-12 nixie tubes as digit displays.

The [NCV2.1-NN kit by TubeHobby](https://tubehobby.com/show_det.php?det=43) was used to power the clock. The kit was originally designed for IN-14 and IN-18 nixie tubes, and was hand-wired in order to accomodate the IN-12 tubes that I used.

A [Particle WiFi Development Board](https://store.particle.io/products/photon) is used to sync time and generate a GPS signal to be sent to the clock electronics.
